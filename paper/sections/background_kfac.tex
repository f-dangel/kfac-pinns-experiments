\subsection{Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC)}

\toodoo{F.D.
  Write this section.
  Mention the concept of weight sharing~\cite{eschenhagen2023kroneckerfactored}, which will hopefully allow to justify many of the approximations we will later use.}

\begin{itemize}
\item KFAC for regression
\item reduction of per iteration complexity
\end{itemize}
