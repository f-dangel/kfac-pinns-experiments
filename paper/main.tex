\begin{abstract}
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks are hard to train with first-order methods. Recently, second-order methods like natural gradients and Gauß-Newton methods in the residual have shown promising performance. However, they come with a high computational cost per iteration. Using higher-order forward mode differentiation, we propose a Kronecker-Factored approximation of the Gauß-Newton matrix that involves PDE-specific terms. We provide an efficient implementation and an experimental evaluation. 
  %To train PINNs efficiently, it has been observed that taking the geometry implied by the PDE operator.
  %Existing methods that consider this geometry compute and invert the full Gramian.
  %However, these ENGD-based methods do not scale well to architectures with many parameters due to the quadratic memory and cubic time complexity of storing and inverting the Gramian.
  %The challenge to develop approximations to the Gramian is that it requires taking the parameter derivative of the PDE operator, which itself contains higher-order derivative.
  %Here, we propose a Kronecker-factored approximation for the Gramian, which scales more favourably than existing approaches in terms of both time and memory, while showing similar performance downstream.
