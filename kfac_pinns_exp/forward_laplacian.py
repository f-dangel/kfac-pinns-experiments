    Args:
        layers: A list of layers defining the NN.
        x: The input to the first layer. First dimension is batch dimension.
        coordinates: List of indices specifying the Hessian diagonal entries
            that are summed into the Laplacian. If `None`, all diagonal entries
            are summed. Default: `None`.
